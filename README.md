# MDFS Mechatronic Demonstration
This program is designed to demonstrate the various methods of controlling 
motors through the arduino framwork.

## Installation
The system uses `platformio`, an embedded framwork designed to
 co-operate between all the different architectures of micro-controllers.

Installing the system is as simple as ensuring you have platformio installed (either 
the CLI or the VSCode plugin) and opening the project in your editor of choice.

## Usage
To use the system, either open it in the VSCode platfomio plugin, or run the 
platformio CLI. The pin wiring required can be found in the main file.

The default environment is set up for use with an Arduino Uno, but this can be changed
by modifying the `platform.ini` file.
